## Welcome to My Page

You can find my website on [themaverickphysici.wixsite.com](https://themaverickphysici.wixsite.com/website). I write physics stuffs there when I find something interesting to write on and some free time.


### A little bit about me
I am an undergrad physics enthusiast at IISc Bangalore. When I am not doing physics you would find me watching anime. I hope to put up a detailed blog sometime on the animes I have watched; in particular my best scenes, favourite characters and why they are awesome. I also enjoy playing chess. I am still an amateur at it though. You can see my chess profile(@monochrome_life on lichess) and we can have a match sometime. I am also learning to play ukulele. Apart from all these I enjoy solving math problems especially Olympiad/Putnam questions.
